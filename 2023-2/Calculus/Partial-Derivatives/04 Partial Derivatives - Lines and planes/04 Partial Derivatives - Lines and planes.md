# *Introducion to lines and planes*
---
* In this section we'll look at all diferents ways to represent lines and planes in space. More specifically, we'll investigate vector equations, parametric equations, and symmetric equations, all of which can be used to represent both lines and planes.
* Let's get started by looking at those kinds of equations, but then we'll look at other applications of lines and planes, like how to determine where a line and a plane intersect one another, how to determine the angle between two planes, or how to find the distance between a point and a plane or a line and a plane
