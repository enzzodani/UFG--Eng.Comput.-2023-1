# *Introduction to differentials*

Remember that the differentials of a single variable functions are $dy$ and $dx$, and the relationship between them is given by 

$$
dy = f'(x)dx
$$

When you find the differential of a multivariable function, you're finding the same thing, but just with more variable. So to get the differential of a multivariable function $z = f(x,y)$, so use either of the formulas

$$
dz = f_xdx + f_ydy
$$

$$
df = f_xdx+f_ydy
$$

In this section we'll look at how to calculate differentials for multivariable functions. We'll get started with a few examples
