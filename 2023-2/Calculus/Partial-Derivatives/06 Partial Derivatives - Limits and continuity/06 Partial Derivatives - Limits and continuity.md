# *Limits and continuity*
---

* When we move from single variable fuctions into multivariable functions, we have to change the way that we investigate limitis and continuity.
* For example, with single variable functions we know that the limit exists if the left-hand limit exists, the right-hand limit exists, and if both limits are equal to one another. But with multivariable functions, we can't just look at the limit as we approach from the left and from the right. With a three-dimensional surface, we can literally approach from an infinite number of directions in space.
* Because there are an infinite number of directions from which to approach any particular point in space, it's impossible for us to test every single one to make sure they're all equal. Therefore, we default to looking for one path that has a different limit than another, rather than attempting to check an infinite number of paths.
* In this section, we'll investigate limits and continuity for multivariable function. Let's get started by looking how to find the domain of a multivariable fuction.
