# *Introduction to Chain Rule*
---
We already know how to apply chain rule to the derivative whenever we differentiate a single variable function, and now we're going to look at how to apply chain rule to the partial derivatives whenever we differentiate a multivariable function.

Sometimes this can get a little confusiong, but if we need to, we can always use a tree diagram to help us keep track of how we're applying the chain rule.

In this section we'll look at chain rule for multivariable functions, plus three diagrams. Let's get started with an overview of the chain rule and a couple of examples.
