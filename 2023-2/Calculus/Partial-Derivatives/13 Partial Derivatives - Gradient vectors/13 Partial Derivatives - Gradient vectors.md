# *Introduction to gradient vectors*
The gradient vector for a function at a particular point tells you how steep the slope of the function is at that point.

In this section we'll look at how to find the gradient vector of a function at a point and how to use the gradient vector to find the direction that has the steepest slope. In other words, if I'm standing on the edge of a mountain, the gradient vector at the point where I'm standing will tell me which direction to walk if I want to take the steepest path, or shallowest path from that point.

Let's get started with a few examples of how to find a gradient vector.

# *Gradient Vectors*

The gradient vector is also called the maximum directional derivative.

To find the gradient vector of a two variable function, we'll need to find the direction in which it occurs using the formula

$$
\nabla f(x,y) = <\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}>
$$
