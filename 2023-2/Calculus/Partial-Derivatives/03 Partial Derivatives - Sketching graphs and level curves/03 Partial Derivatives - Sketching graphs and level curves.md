## *Sketching graphs and level curves*

* In the same way the we used to sketch single variable functions as curves in the $xy$-plane, we're going to focus now on sketching multivariable functions as surfaces in $xyz$-space.
* When we add a third dimension $z$ to $xy$-plane, we get three-dimensional space, and lines becomes planes circles becomes spheres, and parabolas that look like bowls or cups.
* In this section we'll learn the basics of sketching surfaces in three-dimensional space, and how to understand the connection between 3D surfaces and 2D curves.
* Let's get started with three-dimensional graphs and their two-dimensional level curves.
